The Crypto++ package was used for this project. It was installed using the
following command in a Linux machine:
sudo apt-get install libcrypto++-dev libcrypto++-doc libcrypto++-utils

There are three different programs, one for the client, one for the server, 
and one for the certificate authority. The client program and source code
should be placed in a directory called clientFiles, the server in serverFiles,
and the certificate authority in CAFiles. These three directories should be 
placed in another directory that also contains the utility header and source 
files, along with the Makefile. Using the make command will compile the code
and place the programs in their respective directories. Each program should be 
run in a different terminal.

It was originally intended to have a CA distribute the keys for the symmetric
encryption, but the RSA encryption could not encrypt the key because it was too
long. As a result, we assumed that the client and server have already obtained
their keys for AES from each other using the asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA.
